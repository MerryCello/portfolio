         Wolves are highly social animals that live in packs. A pack is an 
         extended family group comprised of a the breeding, or “alpha” male 
         and female pair and some of their  subordinate offspring and current 
         pups from one or more years. The alpha wolves decide when the pack will 
         travel and hunt, and normally are the first to eat at a kill. The 
         pair’s offspring normally disperse into adjacent or available 
         territories at 2 to 3 years of age. For packs studied in the Northern 
         Rocky Mountain region, the average dispersal distance and subsequent 
         new pack formation is about 65 miles. For highly cursorial and very 
         mobile wolves, this is “next-door.” Recent satellite-collar tracking 
         data, however has shown that some offspring and individual wolves have 
         dispersed more than a thousand miles in three or four months!</p>

         Although all the functions of howling are not known, scientists 
         believe that wolves may howl to assemble their pack, to claim territory, 
         to warn intruders away from a home site or kill, or to identify other 
         wolves. Wolves also howl in the evening and early morning, in the summer 
         when pups are young, and during the mid-winter breeding season. It is a 
         myth that wolves howl at the moon, but they do point their snouts toward 
         the sky to howl. Projecting their call upward allows the sound to carry 
         farther. Wolves have excellent hearing, and under certain conditions can 
         hear a howl as far as six miles away in the forest and ten miles away on 
         the open tundra.</p>

         <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Wolf pups are weaned at about 8 weeks of age once they have begun 
         eating semi-solid food, regurgitated by the mother or others members 
         of the pack. As pups begin eating more solids, they are moved to one 
         or more “rendezvous sites,” where they spend the remainder of the 
         summer learning proper pack behavior and etiquette. At 6 to 8 months, 
         the pups begin to travel with the pack and join in hunts. Fewer than 
         half of wolf pups born in the wild survive to adulthood. Survival rates 
         are affected by disease, malnutrition and predation.</p>

         Few wolves live more than 5 years in the wild, but with ideal 
         conditions can reach 15 years of age. Wolf populations are naturally 
         regulated by prey density and territorial disputes among wolves. In many 
         areas, numbers are mainly limited by human-related factors, including 
         illegal killing, control efforts to address livestock depredation and 
         car accidents. As wolves return to Washington and expand their range 
         in Idaho, it is expected that pack sizes will be similar to those found 
         in the Northern Rockies, which average 5 to 10 animals. In areas with 
         abundant prey, packs can have 20 or more members.</p>

         Large predators like wolves and cougar play an important role in 
         maintaining the health of natural ecosystems. Wolves prey primarily on 
         animals that are young or elderly, sick or injured, and weak or unfit, 
         thus keep prey populations healthy.</p>

         <p>Wolf kills create an abundant and dependable food source for many 
         other species. Researchers have documented wolf kills benefiting coyotes, 
         bald eagles, golden eagles, grizzly bears, black bears, ravens, magpies, 
         red foxes and at least 20 other species.</p>

         <p>By preventing large herbivores, such as deer and elk, from becoming 
         overpopulated wolves help maintain native biodiversity. Deer and elk 
         can overgraze their habitat when populations outgrow the carrying 
         capacity of an ecosystem. Overgrazing destroys the plant base, making 
         the habitat less suitable for other species. When gray wolves were 
         reintroduced into Yellowstone National Park in1995 after a 70-year 
         absence, they began to restore ecosystems that had been degraded in 
         their absence.</p>
